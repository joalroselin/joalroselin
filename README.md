## Hey! ðŸ‘‹

<p>Welcome to my Github! It's a bit of a mess but I'm working on it.<br>
  Feel free to let me know if you find anything interesting or want to point something out.</p>

##Quick Bits âš¡
<ul>
  <li>I'm a self-taught software developer. I'm currently trying to become a web developer and is **learning React**</li>
  <li>I am a **gamer** and love creating game-related products (mechanics, writing, academic research, development, streaming, etc).</li>
  <li>I'm **ADHD** and many of my personal passion dev ideas revolve around solving accessibility with technology.</li>
  <li>I'm also _trying_ to start conversations on the intersection of tech and ethics and its impact on social progress and everyday life. _It's not going very well._</li>
  <li>I'm obsessed with mechanical keyboards and an all around tech gear head.</li>
</ul>

##What I'm Working On ðŸŒ±
<ul>
  <li>A React based website for my health tech startup - Sentinellium</li>
  <li>A personal web portfolio of sorts to showcase all my skills and products. _Eventually I want to offer simple web portfolios as a service for college kids._</li>
  <li>A guitar trainer app. It's essentially a memorization assistive app for learning the fretboard.</li>
  <li>Focus: a reading assistant for those with ADHD and Dsylexic symptoms.</li>
</ul>

<p>Aside from learning how to learn, teaching myself development and adjacent skills with only free resources is hard. And so progress has been slow.</p>
<p>But I'm having so much fun. Come check back every once in a while for new updates!</p>
